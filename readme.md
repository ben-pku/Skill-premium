# Skill Premium Readme
By Zhuokai Huang

## Trade Code
Matlab codes including steady state and transitional dynamics solution. 
In the near future, we will add calibration and counterfactual codes into this part.
The latest edition is V6.2 with three sectors and two kinds of labor. This model can successfully address with Dual Economy in China and generate increasing skill premium path.
We mainly refer to Caliendo, Dvorkin, Parro, (2019) and Kleinman, Liu, Redding, (2022) to construct our dynamic spatial model.


## Data Code
Stata and Python programs intended to clean economics data: UNIDO, NIPA, NBER Manufacturing, Urban Houldhold Survey 1986-2010, CFPS 2010-2020, Current Population Survey, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Korean KGSS, German Allbus Panel, etc.
We applied matplotlib in Python to create nice figures.
